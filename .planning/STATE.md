## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- One-pager MVP (not multi-page): Speed to launch, single scroll from social media
- No external links in v1: Lean first shot, focus on visual/content structure
- Hardcoded data in constants.ts: No CMS needed for MVP, can migrate later

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: France SVG outline and kidney-shaped tour path must be sourced/designed before FranceMap implementation. Natural Earth for France outline, custom bezier for kidney route. Station SVG viewport coordinates also needed once viewBox is finalized.
- [Phase 4]: Mentions legales page requires real legal content (RNA/SIRET, operator address, directeur de publication) from the project owner — this is a human input dependency, not a code task.
