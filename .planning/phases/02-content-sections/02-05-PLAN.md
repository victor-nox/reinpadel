<objective>
Compose all section components into the final one-pager page.tsx, replacing the Phase 1 showcase content. Then visually verify the complete page works on mobile and desktop.

Purpose: This is the integration point — all six sections assembled into a single scrollable page. Without this, the sections exist as isolated components but the visitor never sees the complete story.
Output: Updated page.tsx rendering the full one-pager, visually verified.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Compose all sections into page.tsx</name>
  <files>src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Replace the entire content of src/app/page.tsx (currently the Phase 1 showcase) with the one-pager composition.

    **Structure:**
    ```tsx
    import { HeroSection } from '@/components/sections/HeroSection'
    import { MissionSection } from '@/components/sections/MissionSection'
    import { DiseaseSection } from '@/components/sections/DiseaseSection'
    import { ParticipationSection } from '@/components/sections/ParticipationSection'
    import { PartnersSection } from '@/components/sections/PartnersSection'
    import { FooterSection } from '@/components/sections/FooterSection'

    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <>
          <main>
            <HeroSection />
            <MissionSection />
            <DiseaseSection />
            <ParticipationSection />
            <PartnersSection />
          </main>
          <FooterSection />
        </>
      )
    }
    ```

    **Key decisions:**
    - `<main>` wraps all content sections (semantic HTML — PERF-04)
    - `<FooterSection />` is outside `<main>` because `<footer>` is a document-level landmark, not part of main content
    - No wrapper div or extra classes needed — each section handles its own background/padding
    - Server Component by default (no "use client" needed — all sections are server components)
    - Remove ALL Phase 1 showcase code — the Button/SectionWrapper/typography demos are no longer needed

    **PERF-04 semantic HTML audit:** After writing page.tsx, verify that:
    - HeroSection uses `<section id="hero">` with `<h1>`
    - MissionSection uses SectionWrapper (`<section>`) with `<h2>`
    - DiseaseSection uses SectionWrapper (`<section>`) with `<h2>`
    - ParticipationSection uses SectionWrapper (`<section>`) with `<h2>` and `<h3>` per card
    - PartnersSection uses SectionWrapper (`<section>`) with `<h2>`
    - FooterSection uses `<footer>` with `<nav aria-label="...">`
    - All `<Image>` components have non-empty `alt` attributes
    If any section is missing semantic elements or alt text, fix it in the section file (the section files were created in Plans 02-04 and are in files_modified of those plans, but since this plan depends on them, the executor can read and fix issues).

  <files>src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Human visual verification of the complete one-pager. Claude has built all 6 sections and composed them into page.tsx.

    What was built: Complete one-pager with all 6 content sections — Hero (logo + headline + CTAs on blue gradient), Mission (text + quote + fact cards), Disease (white on dark blue + stats), Participation (3 action cards), Partners (19 logos with grayscale hover), Footer (dark blue, 3 columns).

    How to verify:
    1. Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000
    2. Desktop (1280px+): Scroll from top to bottom — all sections visible, no overflow, no broken images
    3. Mobile (375px): Use browser DevTools responsive mode — all sections stack properly, text is readable, no horizontal scroll
    4. Hero: Logo visible, "REIN PADEL TOUR 2026" H1, red date badge, two CTA buttons
    5. Mission: Two columns on desktop (text left, facts right); Antoine's quote in blockquote
    6. Disease: Dark blue background, white text readable, 3 stat numbers in cyan
    7. Participation: 3 cards with different colored buttons (blue/red/outline)
    8. Partners: Logo grid — hover a logo to see it change from grayscale to color
    9. Footer: Logo, nav links, social icons, copyright
    10. Smooth scroll: Click "Decouvrir la mission" CTA in hero — should smooth-scroll to Mission section

    Resume signal: Type "approved" to confirm the one-pager looks correct, or describe any visual issues to fix.

  </verify>
  <done>User has approved the visual appearance of the complete one-pager on both desktop and mobile viewports.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npm run build` passes with no errors
- `grep -c 'HeroSection\|MissionSection\|DiseaseSection\|ParticipationSection\|PartnersSection\|FooterSection' src/app/page.tsx` returns 6+ (all sections imported/rendered)
- Page loads at http://localhost:3000 with no 404 errors for images

<success_criteria>
The one-pager is fully composed and visually verified on both desktop and mobile viewports. All sections render in the correct order with proper responsive behavior. The Phase 1 showcase is gone.
</success_criteria>
